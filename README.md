# JSON Schema Visualizer(Schyma)

Schyma is a tool designed to simplify the visualization of JSON Schemas, making it less tedious to learn how different parts of api specs are connected(especially when you‚Äôre just starting). The visualizer takes JSON Schema files as input and generates a user-friendly graphical representation of the specification.

## Features

- Import JSON Schemas: The visualizer supports various JSON Schemas, such as AsyncAPI, Postman Collection Format, OpenAPI (formerly Swagger), Github Action Spec and so much more. You can easily import your JSON Schema files into the tool.

- Interactive Visualization: The visualizer provides an interactive and intuitive graphical representation of the JSON Schema. Names, Descriptions, Examples, and other essential details are visually presented for better understanding.

## Upcoming Features

- Search and Filtering: Quickly search for specific part of the spec or filter. This feature enhances the user experience when dealing with large JSON Schemas.

- Ability to support very large JSON Schemas

- Additional Panel to render selected Node Schema

- Generating dummy APIs fronm the given specification

## Supported JSON Schema Formats

The JSON Schema Visualizer currently supports the following JSON Schema formats:
`.json`

  return (
    <div className="App">
        <Schyma title="Name of Specification" description="Specification Description" schema={schema} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
