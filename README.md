# API Specification Visualizer(Serval)

The API Specification Visualizer is a tool designed to simplify the visualization of API specifications, making it less tedious to learn how different parts of api specs are connected(especially when you‚Äôre just starting). The visualizer takes API specification files as input and generates a user-friendly graphical representation of the specification.

## Features

- Import API Specifications: The visualizer supports various API specifications, such as AsyncAPI, Postman Collection Format, OpenAPI (formerly Swagger), Github Action Spec and so much more. You can easily import your API specification files into the tool.

- Interactive Visualization: The visualizer provides an interactive and intuitive graphical representation of the API Specification. Names, Descriptions, Examples, and other essential details are visually presented for better understanding.

## Upcoming Features

- Search and Filtering: Quickly search for specific part of the spec or filter. This feature enhances the user experience when dealing with large API specifications.

- Ability to support very large API specifications

- Additional Panel to show the API specification JSON Schema

- Generating dummy APIs fronm the given specification

## Supported API Specification Formats

The API Specification Visualizer currently supports the following API specification formats:
`.json`

export default function App() {

  return (
    <div className="App">
        <Serval title="Name of Specification" description="Specification Description" schema={schema} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
